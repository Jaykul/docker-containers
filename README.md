# Jaykul's Docker Images

This is just a repository of dockerfiles. It currently consists mostly of images I made during the building and testing of my [Jupyter PowerShell Kernel](https://github.com/Jaykul/Jupyter-PowerShell), including one for a container with the latest .NET Core SDK and PowerShell, and some compiled output images with jupyter configured to auto-start.
